# Healthcare costs prediction with linear regression:
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of performing a regression task using linear regression. 
Linear regression is a fundamental technique in the field of data science that allows us to model and predict relationships between variables. 

This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp challenges from the Machine Learning with Python course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the concept of linear regression and its application to a real-world dataset. 
Linear regression is a statistical method that aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

## Dataset
We use the [FreeCodeCamp insurance]([url](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/health-costs/insurance.csv)) dataset for this regression task. The dataset consists of numerical and categorical variables of more than 1300 people. The goal is to build a linear regression model that accurately predicts the healthcare costs based on the provided features.

## Model 
We use a Random Forest Regressor that is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. 
It's used for regression tasks, which involve predicting a continuous numerical output based on input features. 
The Random Forest Regressor is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is primarily used for classification tasks.

## Results
The notebook covers the process of :
- Data loading,
- Some statistics about data,
- Data preprocessing,
- Cross validation,
- Model training,
- Grid searching
